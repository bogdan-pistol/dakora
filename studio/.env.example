### Studio environment example
# When VITE_AUTH_REQUIRED is set to 'false' the frontend will skip Clerk and run unauthenticated.
# Default is true (or unset) which enables Clerk and requires VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY.

# Set to 'false' to disable auth in UI for local development against unauthenticated backend APIs
VITE_AUTH_REQUIRED=false

# Clerk publishable key (only needed when VITE_AUTH_REQUIRED is true)
# VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
